	<name>XTrans</name>
	<short>A compact free multi-documents text editor (featured syntax highlighting, find/replace, bookmarks, undo/redo, etc.) allows a XML/XSL developer to build XSL templates (by inserting prepared XSL and HTML constructions) using the XPath analyzer, then test XSL transformation. The result may be shown in the built in browser.</short>
	<long>Features
Standard text editing functions
It has copy/paste, find/replace, bookmarks and other features.
XSL and HTML synatax highlighting
There is smart selection of highlighting: for XML, XSL and HTML types of documents. You can designate your own color set.
Symmetric conception
It's mean, there was a basic idea - the result of a XML transformation is a XML, so the original XML has the same right as the derived and then you can apply another transformation to the derived.
Possibility to open many documents both types
You can process several data XML files through one XSL transformation, or on the contrary - to design several stylesheets and try how they work on a single XML
Template to create a new XSL or XML document
For an user who is not quite familiar with the structure of XML/XSL file it will be useful to start with a common template of the document.
External insets - insertable parts of code
You can define your own set of code bits by edit a simple XML file.
Recent tags memorizer
The program remember all tags you have typed and all of them already were in the file before. You can then simple insert them to the document.
XSL transformation tool
Just open both XML and XSL document, and apply the transformation. If there is an error, the cursor will be placed to the position when the error has occured.
Inplace browser preview
Each document can be shown in built in browser. You can easy switch between views by key combination.
Text normalizer
If an XML document well-formed, you can apply the normalize tool. Text will be indent by its hieararhy structure.
XPath query analizer
By this tool you can debug your XPath expression you need. You will see a node-set list contains element name, type and inner values.
Possibility to pass parameters to the transformation
Sometimes it's usefull to pass one or more parameters to the stylesheet. XTrans can do it now.
Mouseless operations
The user interface was designed for a user who prefer use the keyboard instead the mouse.
